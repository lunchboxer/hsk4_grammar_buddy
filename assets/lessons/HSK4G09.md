## 语法解释(英文)

The adverb "却" is used to express a contrast or an unexpected situation that is contrary to what was described previously. It connects two contrasting ideas or outcomes, often highlighting the latter as being surprising or unexpected.

## 例句解释  

> 我来了,他**却**没来。
>
> (I came, but he did not come.)

This sentence uses "却" to contrast the speaker's action of coming with the unexpected outcome of the other person not coming, despite the implicit expectation that both would come.

> 同学们都出去活动了,他**却**坐在教室里面不动。
>
> (All the other students went out for activities, but he just sat motionless in the classroom.)  

Here, "却" sets up a contrast between the action of the other students going out, and the surprising behavior of this particular student remaining sedentary in the classroom.
