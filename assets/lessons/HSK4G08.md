# 频率、重复副词:一再、再三

## 语法解释(英文)  

These two adverbs convey the meaning of repetition or frequency of an action:

- 一再 (repeatedly/time and again) indicates that an action or behavior is repeated multiple times, often despite objections or dissuasion.

- 再三 (repeatedly/over and over) also expresses the repeated occurrence of something, with a nuance of emphasis or insistence.

## 例句解释

> 他**一再表示**自己不会出席这次会议。
>
> (He repeatedly stated that he would not attend this meeting.)  

一再表示 shows that he voiced his decision not to attend the meeting multiple times, despite any possible opposition.

> 我**再三解释**,他还是不相信。
>
> (No matter how many times I explained, he still didn't believe me.)

再三解释 conveys the speaker's insistent attempts to explain something over and over again to the listener.
